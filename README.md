## X Education - Lead  Scoring Case Study

Industry professionals can purchase online courses from X Education, a company that provides education. Many experts who are interested in the courses visit their website on any given day and search for courses.
On numerous websites and search engines like Google, the firm advertises its courses. Upon arriving at the website, these visitors may browse the courses, submit a form for the course, or watch some videos. These persons are categorised as leads when they fill out a form with their phone number or email address. Additionally, the business receives leads from earlier recommendations. Once these leads are obtained, sales team members begin calling, sending emails, etc. Some leads are converted during this procedure, but most are not. At X Education, the normal lead conversion rate is roughly 30%.
